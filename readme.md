# Reewild Carbon FoodPrint Estimator

A full stack web application that estimates the carbon footprint (added water print as well) of dishes using Google AI Studioâ€™s API.
The system also provides authentication with email verification and add the user details as well as the last login time in the database.

The carbon footprint with the dish is not added in the database (as mentioned in the assignment document).

### Note - The Registration takes around 6-15 seconds (as the JavaMailSender bean is being initialized)

### Frontend Link - https://github.com/vittalkatwe/Reewild-Carbon-Foodprint-With-Auth-Frontend.git

## You can follow this readme file, it has steps to run both frontend and backend.

## Features

### User Authentication

*   **login & signup:** authentication system to protect user accounts.
*   **Email verification:** Ensures that users provide a valid email address during registration.
*   **Last login time:** The timestamp of the last successful login is recorded and stored in the database.

### Carbon Footprint Estimation
*   **ingredient inference:** Uses the Google AI Studio API to infer the ingredients of a dish from its name.
*   **footprint analysis:** Estimates the carbon footprint of each individual ingredient and calculates the total for the entire dish.

## Tech Stack

*   **Backend:** Spring Boot, Spring Security, JWT
*   **Frontend:** React (TypeScript + Vite)
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **AI Integration:** Google AI Studio API
*   **Deployment:** Docker & Docker Hub

## Run Application


### 1. Run Locally 
**Backend (Spring Boot)** (Before running the backend please make sure that the **application.properties** is updated accordingly)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vittalkatwe/Reewild-Carbon-Foodprint-With-Auth-Backend.git
cd Reewild-Carbon-Foodprint-With-Auth-Backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```


**Frontend (React)**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vittalkatwe/Reewild-Carbon-Foodprint-With-Auth-Frontend.git
cd Reewild-Carbon-Foodprint-With-Auth-Frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 2. Run Using Docker

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 vittalkat/carbon-backend
docker run -d -p 5173:5173 vittalkat/frontend-app:latest
```


### Application Properties
**Backend (resources/application.properties)**

## ðŸŒŸ Future Enhancements
**Allow users to save their favorite dishes and track their personal carbon footprint and also suggest lower carbon alternatives for ingredients to promote sustainable choices**

**A dashboard where admin can see the insights**

**Implement caching for frequently requested dishes to reduce API calls**

**User can also see historical footprint comparisons**

**Reward users for choosing lower carbon dishes with points, badges or rank them in leaderboard**

**Multiple language support**

**Try Microservices, where we scale the auth service and carbon estimation services individually as per the traffic**

**Add OAuth2 login (Google, GitHub)**

**Role-based access (Admin, User)**
